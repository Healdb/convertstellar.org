		<h2>General</h2>
		<p>Brookfield High School&#8217s Robotics Team began in the year 2001, under direction of Susan Troupe and Donna Didsbury as the Lions. The first challenge was finding a technical mentor. After spending countless hours in the phonebooks and calling companies, a technical mentor was found.</p>
		<p>The following year, Robert Zapor, the technology education teacher at BHS joined. These three would set the foundation for what our team is today. The team would eventually grow into something much greater than simply the Lions. In 2009, one of our esteemed alumni, Tom Reiske, would perform disco dances during our first ever  regional win, and as a result the team name was changed to the DiscoTechs.</p>
		<p>Our team has experienced numerous ups and downs over the years. For instance, in 2012, Mr. Zapor elected to assist the struggling Panther Project, Team 2064, which caused a major loss to our technical department. However, not all was lost, as Scott Zucca, a mathematics and programming teacher here at BHS, was more than capable of filling the massive gap in our technical area. </p>
		<p>Awards we have won include victories at the Boston Regional competition in 2009 and 2011, Mr. Zapor won the prestigious Woodie Flowers Award at Boston in 2011, and finally the Team Spirit Award at Boston in 2013. Team 1099, has been seen in the eliminations every year since 2009 (excluding 2010).</p>

		<h2>Team Captain</h2>
		<p>Ari Elfenbein was elected Team Captain on June 4, 2014. He will be our Captain through the rest of the 2014 Off-Season and the Entire 2015 Build-Season.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Engineering</h2>
		<p>The engineering squad, which, simply put, is responsible for constructing our robot. With directions provided by our C-Squad as well as our mentors, this hard-working group puts in countless hours towards the ultimate success and making our design a reality.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2 title="Water. Earth. Fire. Ari.
Mrs. Didsbury used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Aritar kept balance between the Water Codes, the Earth Exceptions, the Firewall Nation, and the Ari Programmers. But that all changed when the Firewall Nation attacked. Only the Aritar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firewall-benders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished... to Colorado. A hundred years have passed, we still have not completed construction of our robot, and the Firewall Nation is nearing victory in the War. Two years ago, Mr. Zucca and the mentors of our team journeyed to the Earth Exceptions to help fight against the Firewall Nation, leaving me and my teammates to look after one another. Some people believe that the Aritar was never reborn into the Ari Programmers, and the cycle is broken. But I haven&#8217t lost hope. I still believe that somehow, the Aritar will return to save the world... and our faulty code in our robot.">Programming</h2>
		<p>The programming squad, headed by Ari Elfenbein, is responsible for coding the robot using Java. Without this squad, the robot cannot function whatsoever. The code makes the robot move, and proper integration of the code allows the robot to perform flawlessly during both the autonomous and teleoperated periods (provided Ari doesn&#8217t go to Colorado during the last week of build season).</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>CAD</h2>
		<p>The CADD squad, which is responsible for providing a framework for the robot that the E-Squad puts to work. Using a program called CREO (generously provided to us by our sponsor PTC), Isaac Kochman and his squad make our ideas come to life and start the engineering process.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Business</h2>
		<p>The business and public relations squad, headed by Michael Abbondondolo, is responsible for any non-engineering functions of the team. This includes fundraising, design of our tee shirts and logo, and submitting entries for awards. Although it is the least-populated squad on the team, it, like all the other squads, performs a role essential to our team&#8217s success.</p>
